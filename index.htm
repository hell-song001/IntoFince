                <dt>Risk</dt>
                <dd>A concequence of invetsment that causes a variation in the expected return.
                    Its measured as the standard deviation of the expected returns.
                    The risk depends on the period of the investment. 
                    The longer the period the the higher the uncertainty of the retrun, thus the higher the risk.
